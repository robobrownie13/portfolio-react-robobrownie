        I am a current student developer enrolled at Rice University's Full Flex
        Coding Bootcamp. In May of 2022, I decided to transition fields from
        music education to software development. I spent several months going
        over open source documentation about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The
        follow projects showcase a mix of work I have published from my current
        bootcamp.
