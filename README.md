## Description

This portfolio demonstrates how to render different components onto a singular page using React and useState.

## Usage

Users can interact with the deployed link but should make sure to connect their local clones of the repository to their own github page.

## Installation

To run on their own github page, users can take advantage of the gh-pages dev dependency and change the package-json homepage key value to "http://{github-username}.github.io/{new-repo-name}".
